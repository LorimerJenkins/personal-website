        <p className={styles.title}>About me</p>
        <p>
          I was born in the United Kingdom on the 30th of July 2003, I grew up
          in Hertfordshire and was trained from a young age in Acting and
          Musical Theatre.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I liked Acting, at age 17 I decided it was not for me and
          decided to pursue other careers. The first place I started to look was
          in trying to find something to do with my passion for something called
          Blockchain, I had always longed to work for a Blockchain company but
          never thought I was smart enough or had the degrees to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my peers were pursuing traditional academia at college/uni
          studying STEM subjects, I felt I had shot myself in the foot as at the
          time I was at a acting college. This feeling later turned into one of
          my most valued strengths, being the underdog.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember watching a Gary Vee video at the time on him saying that he
          worked for free when he was younger, as it is super de-risked for a
          company to hire someone for free, they could take a bigger bet on who
          they hired.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I set out and emailed over 500 companies, founders and investment
          firms. I think out of all the emails I did, only about 6 of them hit,
          I am still close with all 6 and continue to work alongside them in
          many ways to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the 6 worked at a venture fund that invested in crypto, he saw
          how hungry I was to just work and put me in contact with the MP of the
          firm who was looking for more interns.
        </p>
        <p>
          This started everything for me, I worked at the firm as a unpaid
          intern for 3 months and after continued to work there as a paid
          analyst for a year. Looking back it was the most mind numbing boring
          work, but I absolutely loved it, I worked on their crypto VC and HF.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having worked at the firm for a year, the partners begun to trust me
          more and I started turning up to pitching calls to make notes for
          their IC. I started trying to look for interesting companies for the
          fund on X one day and I came across a guy called Tate building a DEX.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up until this point I was always the youngest in the room by far, Tate
          was my age (18) at the time and I was ecstatic to chat with him as the
          founder of a DEX at MY AGE.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spoke with Tate a few times about his project, sadly the fund did
          not invest, but I stayed in contact with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although working at a investment fund is great, it is a little boring
          compared to building a startup. So one day I messaged Tate and
          approached him saying that I was looking for a job and if he would be
          interested in working together, he said no.
        </p>
        <p>
          He said no as it was tough to see what role I would fit into,
          extremely gutted and full of the underdog mentality I had developed I
          taught myself to code in a few months.
        </p>
        <p>
          This led me to build my first project, a analytics website for crypto
          transactions. This project grew and we were given a grant for us (me
          and a few Fiverr contractors) to focus on it full time. I quit my
          investment job to work on the project full time and did for a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          After some time I re approached Tate, showed him the project and told
          him I learnt to code. I think this excited Tate as he met so many
          people who said they were going to do things but never did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tate was working on a new idea at the time called Community Labs, they
          had just raised their seed round. I took this opportunity with open
          arms, returned the analytics grant we received and joined as the first
          outside Fellow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked at Community Labs for 2 years or so building various projects
          like Othent, Oases, subsidise-JS and AO Ventures.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in Community Labs I met Marton, we shared many similarities and
          grew close in the company. Marton was the founder of a project called
          ArConnect, a Web3 Arweave wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day while he was on a trip to Cambridge, where I was living at the
          time, we realized how much potential there was for all these tokens in
          Arweave DeFi.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were super lucky that AO, a new computing layer on top of Arweave,
          was in it's infancy. We came up with a idea of a DeFi protocol where
          you could earn interest on your AR tokens and called it Operation
          Liquidity (lets bring liquidity to Arweave).
        </p>
        <p>
          We launched a waitlist where you could sign up with your Arweave
          wallet and pledge assets to the protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the first two hours that waitlist grew to over $2m and over the
          next few months grew to $55m with over 3 thousand email signups.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then re-named the idea to LiquidOps (Operation Liquidity backwards
          and shortened), we raised a pre-seed round for idea of $325k and spun
          out Community Labs as the first fellow spin outs (first one in first
          one out haha).
        </p>
        <p>
          I now spend my time working on LiquidOps, a lending and borrowing
          protocol built on Arweave and AO.

          Thanks for reading, I hope my story can inspire you to chase your
          dreams from a young kid in his attic wanting to work at a Blockchain
          company, to now being the Co-founder and CEO of one, we are just
          getting started at LiquidOps and I am excited to keep building!
