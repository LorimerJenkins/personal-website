    "timeline2024Title": "Founded LiquidOps",
    "timeline2024Description": "This year changed everything. I met Marton in Cambridge and we conceived Operation Liquidity. When we launched the waitlist, we hit $2M in pledges in just 2 hours.

Started indie hacking building out of coffee shops instead of building a VC.",

I emailed over 500 companies, VCs looking for an unpaid internship or any job in the industry. I used to take Zoom meetings in the car park of school with my classmates phone that had data on while I skipped classes to pitch VCs and businesses about potentially hiring me."

      "I love meeting founders who are building something they genuinely care about. When I see potential and ways I can help beyond just capital, I'm eager to get involved early.",
      "I've been through pretty much every job in a startup—CEO, developer, product manager, engineering partner. I've sat on the other side as an investor analyst and fund associate. I've run multiple companies across jurisdictions including UK Limited Liability entities and US Delaware C Corps.",
      "I've participated in and judged hackathons, purchased companies and IP, and once lost my entire net worth overnight to a tax mistake that put me £20k in debt. I've been a content creator, handled COO responsibilities, and can help you avoid the same mistakes I've made.",
      "I've operated and succeeded in both bull and bear markets. Made and lost everything numerous times. Hired and fired people. Had tough conversations with investors. Managed and worked in teams. Fundraised over half a million dollars. Fought off two major black swan events as a crypto founder. I'm well-versed at devising strategies for super complicated problems.",
      "I will fight for you in your darkest hours and won't be afraid to tell you the truth at your highest. Due to compliance, I can't advise on legal, finance, or accounting—but I can introduce you to lawyers, accountants, investors, design agencies, marketing professionals, and accelerator programs I've worked with.",
      "I typically write checks between **$500 and $5,000** in pre-seed and really early seed rounds. Although I don't write the biggest checks, I try to be useful. Whether that's introductions, product feedback, technical advice, or just being someone to talk through problems with—I want to be the kind of investor I'd want on my cap table.",
      "Building something interesting? I'd love to hear about it."

I aim for them to be a great way to build my online community, show the world what I am working on and meet new people in new places.
