    "timeline2024Title": "Founded LiquidOps",
    "timeline2024Description": "I came up with the idea [LiquidOps](/projects#liquidops) with [Marton](https://x.com/martonlederer) this year after a rainy ambisious walk in Cambridge where I was living at the time, while [AO](https://ao.arweave.net) was in it's infancy.",

    "timeline2023Description": "I became the first external Fellow at [Community Labs](https://communitylabs.com) right after their seed round. I returned my analytics grant to focus fully on the [Arweave](https://arweave.org) ecosystem. During my time here I built [Othent](/projects#othent), Oases, Subsidise-JS, and worked as an Engineering Partner on [AO Ventures](https://aoventures.io). I supported the teams in the cohort and help decide who participated in demo day from a technical perspective, I ended up also participating with my new idea - [LiquidOps](/projects#liquidops).",
    "timeline2022Title": "Joined Community Labs & built my first project Wallety",
    "timeline2022Description": "After realising investing didn't excite me as much as building does, I set out on a mission to learn to code from scratch. I ended up picking up learning to code quite quickly and built my first project [Wallety](/projects#wallety). It was exhausting but exhilarating. I then grabbed the attention of [Tate Berenbaum](https://x.com/TateBerenbaum) who became a close friend and I decided to join him at [Community Labs](https://communitylabs).",
    "timeline2021Title": "Broke Into Crypto VC from my bedroom",
    "timeline2021Description": "I landed an unpaid internship at a crypto venture capital fund from the previous years cold emailing. I worked for 3 months without pay before they offered me a paid analyst role, I then worked on their venture and hedge funds for the next year. I spent my time mainly doing due dilligence on dealflow, took notes in their weekly investment communitee meetings and also met with founders who wanted to pitch the firm. During this year I also volunteered a [Polkadot Ambassador](https://polkadot.com/community/ambassador-program) where I helped build out the community and held a IRL London picnic where over 100 people turned up including ecosystem teams and founders.",
    "timeline2020Title": "Crypto Teen & dropping out of drama school",
    "timeline2020Description": "While I was attending drama school at [Emil Dale Academy](https://www.emildale.co.uk), I started a Crypto TikTok educational channel aimed at educating Gen Z on Crypto. Ethereum's price was $201! Selling clothes to pay for Drama school. In a bid to break into the industry I decided to cold email over 500 companies, investment firms and projects on if they would take me on as a unpaid worker. Out of the over 500 emails about 6 hit. I used to take Zoom meetings in the car park of school with my classmates phone that had data on while I skipped classes to pitch VCs and businesses about potentially hiring me, it was a really surreal time in my life and has just kept getting more surreal since."

      "I've been through pretty much every job in a startup—CEO, developer, product manager, engineering partner. I've sat on the other side as an investor analyst and fund associate. I've run multiple companies across jurisdictions including UK Limited Liability entities and US Delaware C Corps.",
      "I've participated in and judged hackathons, purchased companies and IP, and once lost my entire net worth overnight to a tax mistake that put me £20k in debt. I've been a content creator, handled COO responsibilities, and can help you avoid the same mistakes I've made.",
      "I've operated and succeeded in both bull and bear markets. Made and lost everything numerous times. Hired and fired people. Had tough conversations with investors. Managed and worked in teams. Fundraised over half a million dollars. Fought off two major black swan events as a crypto founder. I'm well-versed at devising strategies for super complicated problems.",
      "I will fight for you in your darkest hours and won't be afraid to tell you the truth at your highest. Due to compliance, I can't advise on legal, finance, or accounting—but I can introduce you to lawyers, accountants, investors, design agencies, marketing professionals, and accelerator programs I've worked with.",
      "I typically write checks between **$500 and $5,000** in pre-seed and really early seed rounds. Although I don't write the biggest checks, I try to be useful. Whether that's introductions, product feedback, technical advice, or just being someone to talk through problems with—I want to be the kind of investor I'd want on my cap table.",
      "Building something interesting? I'd love to hear about it."
