    "timeline2025Description": "This year I spent my time launching [LiquidOps' mainnet](https://x.com/Liquid_Ops/status/1905268807746060790?s=20). One of the most valuable lessons I have learnt this year is that startups are not all about product. Growth and marketing are just as (if not more) important than product, so I started [creating content](/projects#content-creator) and focusing on growth.",
    "timeline2024Title": "Founded LiquidOps",
    "timeline2024Description": "I came up with the idea [LiquidOps](/projects#liquidops) with [Marton Lederer](https://x.com/martonlederer) this year after a rainy ambitious walk in Cambridge where I was living at the time. [AO](https://ao.arweave.net) was in it's infancy and we quickly realised the potential for a way to leverage the ecosystems current liquidity. I also worked as an Engineering Partner on [AO Ventures](https://aoventures.io). I supported teams in the cohort and helped decide who participated in demo day from a technical perspective, I ended up also participating with my new idea - [LiquidOps](/projects#liquidops).",

    "timeline2023Description": "I became the first external Fellow at [Community Labs](https://communitylabs.com) right after their seed round.

During my time here I built [Othent](/projects#othent), Oases and [Subsidise.js](/projects#subsidisejs).",
    "timeline2022Title": "Joined Community Labs & taught myself to code",
    "timeline2022Description": "After realising investing didn't excite me as much as building does, I set out on a mission to learn to code from scratch. I ended up picking up learning to code quite quickly and built my first project [Wallety](/projects#wallety). It was exhausting but exhilarating. I then grabbed the attention of [Tate Berenbaum](https://x.com/TateBerenbaum) who became a close friend and I decided to join him at [Community Labs](https://communitylabs.com) as their first outside Fellow.",

    "timeline2021Description": "I landed an unpaid internship at a crypto venture capital fund from the previous years cold emailing. I worked for 3 months without pay before they offered me a paid analyst role, I then worked on their venture and hedge funds for the next year. I spent my time mainly doing due dilligence on dealflow, took notes in their weekly investment communitee meetings and also met with founders who wanted to pitch the firm. During this year I also volunteered a [Polkadot Ambassador](https://polkadot.com/community/ambassador-program) where I helped build out the community and held a IRL London picnic where over 100 people turned up including ecosystem teams and founders.",
    "timeline2020Title": "Crypto Teen & dropping out of drama school",
    "timeline2020Description": "While I was attending drama school at [Emil Dale Academy](https://www.emildale.co.uk), I started a Crypto TikTok educational channel aimed at educating Gen Z on Crypto. In a bid to break into the industry I decided to cold email over 500 companies, investment firms and projects on if they would take me on as a unpaid worker. Out of the over 500 emails about 6 hit. I used to take Zoom meetings in the car park of school with my classmates phone that had data on while I skipped classes to pitch VCs and businesses about potentially hiring me. It was a really surreal time in my life and has just kept getting more surreal since. This was also the year I fundraised for Drama School by collecting peoples old clothes/things to resell on eBay to pay for tuition fees after getting inspiration from Gary Vee, it worked!",
