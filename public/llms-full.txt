## Timeline & Journey

### 2025: Launched LiquidOps Mainnet & Focused on Growth

This year Lorimer launched LiquidOps' mainnet. One of the most valuable lessons learned: startups are not all about product. Growth and marketing are just as (if not more) important than product. Started creating content and focusing on growth.

Key moments:
- Started creating video content on YouTube
- Attended ETH Denver
- LiquidOps fair launch
- LiquidOps testnet launch, then mainnet
- First time staying in San Francisco
- Created video "22 years old and £20k in debt" documenting founder financial struggles

### 2024: Founded LiquidOps

Came up with LiquidOps idea with Marton Lederer after a rainy walk in Cambridge. AO was in its infancy and they realized the potential for leveraging the ecosystem's liquidity.

Also worked as Engineering Partner at AO Ventures—supported teams in the cohort and helped decide demo day participants from a technical perspective. Ended up participating with LiquidOps.

Key moments:
- Featured in VentureBeat, Perma DAO, IBTimes
- AO Ventures workshops and Demo Day pitch
- Valencia team retreat
- Raised $325k pre-seed round

### 2023: Othent Built on Arweave

Became the first external Fellow at Community Labs right after their seed round. Returned the Wallety grant to focus fully on the Arweave ecosystem. Built Othent, Oases, and Subsidise.js.

Key moments:
- New York with Marton Lederer
- Virginia team retreat
- Buenos Aires team retreat
- Podcasts with Greg Albritton and Tom Wilson
- Arweave Berlin 5th anniversary
- Moved to Cambridge, UK
- Fireside chat at Virginia Tech

### 2022: Joined Community Labs & Taught Myself to Code

After realizing investing didn't excite as much as building, set out to learn to code from scratch. Picked it up quickly and built first project Wallety. Then grabbed attention of Tate Berenbaum, who became a close friend, and joined Community Labs.

Key moments:
- Architecting Othent with Tate
- Community Labs day 1
- Podcast with Peter Lu
- Doubled down on startups

### 2021: Broke into Crypto VC from Bedroom

Landed unpaid internship at crypto VC fund from cold emailing. Worked 3 months without pay before being offered paid analyst role. Worked on venture and hedge funds for a year—due diligence on dealflow, notes in investment committee meetings, met with founders pitching the firm.

Also volunteered as Polkadot Ambassador—helped build community and held IRL London picnic with 100+ attendees including ecosystem teams and founders.

Key moments:
- Aves Lair day 1
- Polkadot Ambassador activities
- Created Polkadot.js walkthrough
- Organized Polkadot events with custom t-shirts
- Built crypto trading bots
- Cold emailing calls from bedroom

### 2020: Crypto Teen & Dropping Out of Drama School

While attending drama school at Emil Dale Academy, started Crypto Teen—a TikTok channel educating Gen Z on crypto. Cold-emailed 500+ companies, investment firms, and projects for unpaid work opportunities. Out of 500+ emails, about 6 responded.

Took Zoom meetings in school car park with classmate's phone data while skipping classes to pitch VCs and businesses. Also fundraised for drama school by reselling old clothes on eBay (inspired by Gary Vee).

Key moments:
- Reselling clothes to fund college tuition
- Crypto Teen TikTok launch
- Built Instagram follower bots
- Started dipping toes into coding

### 2019: Joined Ethereum Community

Joined Ethereum community after learning about smart contracts. ETH was at $201.13.

### 2017: Hustling at School

While classmates were selling sweets, Lorimer was fixing phone screens for cash.

## Angel Investing

Lorimer loves meeting fellow founders who are building something they genuinely care about. When there's potential and ways to help beyond just capital, eager to get involved early.

Typical check size: **$500 to $5,000** in pre-seed and really early seed rounds. Although not the biggest checks, tries to be useful—introductions, product feedback, technical advice, or just being someone to talk through problems with.

**Disclosure**: Currently a full-time founder and plans to be for the foreseeable future, so cannot allocate full-time attention to portfolio companies. Usually only invests in companies building in similar environments to current or past work, enabling direct help with problem-solving.

## Angel Investing Disclosures

### Personal Capital Only

Lorimer invests his own personal money. He is NOT a venture capital fund, does NOT manage a fund, and does NOT accept capital from limited partners (LPs) or any other external investors. All investment decisions are made solely using own funds.

### Not Investment Advice

Nothing on the website should be construed as investment, legal, accounting, tax, or life advice. Lorimer is NOT authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or any other financial regulatory body. Any investment decisions you make are your own responsibility.

### No Fiduciary Duty

No fiduciary duty is owed to founders or companies invested in beyond what is set out in the relevant investment documentation. Lorimer is an investor, not an advisor, director, or fiduciary.

### Not a Solicitation

Nothing on the website constitutes a solicitation, offer, or recommendation to invest in any company, security, or investment product. Any information about portfolio companies is for informational purposes only.

### No Guarantee of Investment

Contacting or sending a pitch does NOT guarantee investment. Opportunities are reviewed selectively and investment is made in very few companies each year (maximum 1-2).

### Limited Availability

Currently a full-time founder and plans to be for the foreseeable future, so cannot allocate full-time attention to portfolio companies. Usually only invests in companies building in similar environments to current or past work, for direct help with problem-solving.

### No Advisory Relationships

Does not advise companies or founders. Believes advisors are misaligned (unless for really late-stage companies)—watch Steve Jobs explain why: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c4CNB80SRc. Only angel invests in founders and ideas worth getting involved with and where direct building help is possible.

### Early Stage Focus

Probably not going to be helpful to later-stage founders. Early stage personally and can best help people at the earliest stages (before Series A). But if a late-stage founder thinks there's potential help, still interested.

### Tax Considerations

Any tax reliefs mentioned (such as SEIS or EIS) are subject to individual circumstances and HMRC rules. Seek independent tax advice. No representations made about the tax status of any investment.

### Confidentiality

If confidential information is shared, it will be treated with reasonable care, but absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. May be exposed to similar ideas from other sources. Do not share information you are not comfortable disclosing. Unless a separate written confidentiality agreement is signed, there is no obligation to treat information sent as confidential.

### Conflicts of Interest

May invest in companies that compete with each other or with companies being built. No obligation to disclose other investments, and no obligation to refrain from investing in competing companies.

### Risk Warning

**Angel investing in early-stage companies involves a high degree of risk.** You could lose your entire investment. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The value of investments can go down as well as up. Early-stage investments are illiquid and you may not be able to sell your shares for many years, if ever.

### UK Investor Status

Lorimer is a **Self-Certified Sophisticated Investor** under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005. Qualifies on the basis of having worked in a professional capacity in the provision of finance for small and medium enterprises within the past two years (as a contractor for blockchain accelerator programs involving early-stage investment).

**For Founders:** By sharing investment materials, you confirm that you have conducted appropriate checks under the UK Financial Promotions regime and reasonably believe Lorimer is eligible to receive such communications. If a self-certification form is needed before sharing a pitch, happy to sign.
