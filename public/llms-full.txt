## Launched LiquidOps mainnet & focused on growth

This year I spent my time launching [LiquidOps' mainnet](https://x.com/Liquid_Ops/status/1905268807746060790?s=20). One of the most valuable lessons I have learnt this year is that startups are not all about product. Growth and marketing are just as (if not more) important than product, so I started [creating content](https://lorimerjenkins.com/projects#content-creator) and focusing on growth.

## Founded LiquidOps

I came up with the idea [LiquidOps](https://lorimerjenkins.com/projects#liquidops) with [Marton Lederer](https://x.com/martonlederer) this year after a rainy ambitious walk in Cambridge where I was living at the time. [AO](https://ao.arweave.net/) was in it's infancy and we quickly realised the potential for a way to leverage the ecosystems current liquidity. I also worked as an Engineering Partner on [AO Ventures](https://aoventures.io/). I supported teams in the cohort and helped decide who participated in demo day from a technical perspective, I ended up also participating with my new idea - [LiquidOps](https://lorimerjenkins.com/projects#liquidops).

## Othent built on Arweave

I became the first external Fellow at [Community Labs](https://communitylabs.com/) right after their seed round. I returned the [Wallety](https://lorimerjenkins.com/projects#wallety) grant to focus fully on the [Arweave](https://arweave.org/) ecosystem. During my time here I built [Othent](https://lorimerjenkins.com/projects#othent), Oases and [Subsidise.js](https://lorimerjenkins.com/projects#subsidisejs).

## Joined Community Labs & taught myself to code

After realising investing didn't excite me as much as building does, I set out on a mission to learn to code from scratch. I ended up picking up learning to code quite quickly and built my first project [Wallety](https://lorimerjenkins.com/projects#wallety). It was exhausting but exhilarating. I then grabbed the attention of [Tate Berenbaum](https://x.com/TateBerenbaum) who became a close friend and I decided to join him at [Community Labs](https://communitylabs.com/).

## Broke into Crypto VC from my bedroom

I landed an unpaid internship at a crypto venture capital fund from the previous years cold emailing. I worked for 3 months without pay before they offered me a paid analyst role, I then worked on their venture and hedge funds for the next year. I spent my time mainly doing due dilligence on dealflow, took notes in their weekly investment communitee meetings and also met with founders who wanted to pitch the firm. During this year I also volunteered a [Polkadot Ambassador](https://polkadot.com/community/ambassador-program) where I helped build out the community and held a IRL London picnic where over 100 people turned up including ecosystem teams and founders.

## Crypto Teen & dropping out of drama school

While I was attending drama school at [Emil Dale Academy](https://www.emildale.co.uk/), I started a Crypto TikTok educational channel aimed at educating Gen Z on Crypto. In a bid to break into the industry I decided to cold email over 500 companies, investment firms and projects on if they would take me on as a unpaid worker. Out of the over 500 emails about 6 hit. I used to take Zoom meetings in the car park of school with my classmates phone that had data on while I skipped classes to pitch VCs and businesses about potentially hiring me. It was a really surreal time in my life and has just kept getting more surreal since. This was also the year I fundraised for Drama School by collecting peoples old clothes/things to resell on eBay to pay for tuition fees after getting inspiration from Gary Vee, it worked!

This page contains important disclosures regarding my angel investing activities. Please read this information carefully before contacting me about investment opportunities.

## Personal Capital Only

I invest my own personal money. I am **not** a venture capital fund, I do **not** manage a fund, and I do **not** accept capital from limited partners (LPs) or any other external investors. All investment decisions are made solely by me using my own funds.

## Not Investment Advice

Nothing on this website should be construed as investment, legal, accounting, tax, or life advice. I am **not** authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or any other financial regulatory body. Any investment decisions you make are your own responsibility.

## No Fiduciary Duty

I do not owe any fiduciary duty to founders or companies I invest in beyond what is set out in the relevant investment documentation. I am an investor, not an advisor, director, or fiduciary.

## Not a Solicitation

Nothing on this website constitutes a solicitation, offer, or recommendation to invest in any company, security, or investment product. Any information about my portfolio companies is for informational purposes only.

## No Guarantee of Investment

Contacting me or sending me your pitch does **not** guarantee that I will invest. I review opportunities selectively and invest in very few companies each year (maximum 1-2).

## Limited Availability

I'm currently a full-time founder and plan to be one for the foreseeable future, so I cannot allocate full-time attention to portfolio companies. I usually only invest in companies building in similar environments to what I am currently or have built in the past, so I can directly help with problem-solving.

## No Advisory Relationships

I do not advise companies or founders. I think advisors are misaligned (unless for really late-stage companies) — [watch Steve Jobs explain why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c4CNB80SRc). I only angel invest in founders and ideas I want to get involved with and think I can help build.

## Early Stage Focus

I am probably not going to be helpful to later-stage founders. I am early stage myself and can best help people at the earliest stages (before Series A). But if you are a late-stage founder and think I could be helpful, I'm still interested.

## Tax Considerations

Any tax reliefs mentioned (such as SEIS or EIS) are subject to individual circumstances and HMRC rules. You should seek independent tax advice. I make no representations about the tax status of any investment.

## Confidentiality

If you share confidential information with me, I will treat it with reasonable care, but I cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. I may be exposed to similar ideas from other founders. Do not share information you are not comfortable disclosing. Unless I have signed a separate written confidentiality agreement with you, I have no obligation to treat information you send me as confidential.

## Conflicts of Interest

I may invest in companies that compete with each other or with companies you are building. I am under no obligation to disclose my other investments to you, and I am under no obligation to refrain from investing in competing companies.

* * *

## Risk Warning

**Angel investing in early-stage companies involves a high degree of risk.** You could lose your entire investment. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The value of investments can go down as well as up. Early-stage investments are illiquid and you may not be able to sell your shares for many years, if ever.

* * *

#### UK Investor Status

I am a **Self-Certified Sophisticated Investor** under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005. I qualify on the basis of having worked in a professional capacity in the provision of finance for small and medium enterprises within the past two years (as a contractor for blockchain accelerator programs involving early-stage investment).

**For Founders:** By sharing investment materials with me, you confirm that you have conducted appropriate checks under the UK Financial Promotions regime and reasonably believe I am eligible to receive such communications. If you need me to sign a self-certification form before sharing your pitch, I'm happy to do so.

* * *

If you have any questions about these disclosures, please contact me at hellolorimerjenkins@gmail.com.

## AO The Computer .com

2025•Built

A friend told me a story of being able to aquire a really saught after domain for next to nothing, I was amazed (plus a tad jelous) and couldn't stop thinking about the killer deal he got. So I started searching Namecheap to see if there were any other killer deals up for grabs. Turns out [AO The Computer .com](https://aothecomputer.com/) was available to purchase for $11.48 a year, take that \[redacted\] 😜.

## LiquidOps

2024•Co-founder & CEO

A lending and borrowing protocol built on [AO](https://ao.arweave.net/), aiming to unlock over $400m worth of [Arweave](https://arweave.org/) tokens value. I co-founded the project with [Marton Lederer](https://x.com/martonlederer), became the 1st Fellow led company to spin out of [Community Labs](https://www.communitylabs.com/), attracted thousands of [waitlist](https://x.com/Liquid_Ops/status/1863863983498805473?s=20) signups which grew to $55m soft-commits for the idea with on-chain fund verification, [pitched](https://x.com/aoTheVentures/status/1813676139795374171?s=20) at [AO Ventures](https://www.aoventures.io/) demo day and then raised a [$325k pre-seed round](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/revolutionizing-defi-how-lorimer-jenkins-marton-lederer-are-transforming-arweave-liquidops-1729945). We launched mainnet, have numerious intergrations including the AO Chrome/IOS/Andriod wallets [Wander](https://wander.app/) ( [demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ODxijaC0Dc)) & [Beacon](https://getbeaconapp.com/) ( [demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeQ01-rBUPQ&t=11s)).

AO HTML is a tool that enables you to create a webpage via a HTML file that auto updates based on content delivered from the AO network via a process. Imagine a decentralised website with content delivery via a decentralised provider like a DAO, for example the website would auto update after a DAO proposal was approved and all Web2 front ends on Vercel/Netlify would too using this script.

2023•Built

Subsidise JS is a package built to enable [Arweave 4096-bit RSA-PSS JWK's](https://medium.com/@perma_dao/wallet-and-did-in-the-arweave-ecosystem-5714877fe745) to bundle transactions together and pay gas fees for other users transactions via the [ANS-102](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-standards/blob/master/ans/ANS-102.md) Arweave network standard. I planned to intergrate this into other projects who wanted to cover their users gas upload fees, which would enable users to not have to pay AR tokens to use a Web 2 consuer app built on Arweave.

2023•Founder & CEO

The mission of [Othent](https://othent.io/) was to enable normal everyday online consumers to access blockchain projects, without the use of complex cryptographic private keys and instead use any Oauth account access like Google. I founded the project as the 1st outside Fellow incubated within [Community Labs](https://www.communitylabs.com/), a software development company founded by [Tate Berenbaum](https://x.com/TateBerenbaum) in the [Arweave](https://arweave.org/) ecosystem. [Othent](https://othent.io/) was then aquired by [Wander](https://wander.app/) into their core product, an [Arweave](https://arweave.org/) & [AO](https://ao.arweave.net/) ecosystem Web3 wallet that has over 50,000 users, becoming [Wander Connect](https://www.wander.app/connect).

# Angel Investing

I love meeting fellow founders who are building something they genuinely care about. When I see potential and ways I can help beyond just capital, I'm eager to get involved early.

I typically write checks between **$500 and $5,000** in pre-seed and really early seed rounds. Although I don't write the biggest checks, I try to be useful. Whether that's introductions, product feedback, technical advice, or just being someone to talk through problems with, see more in depth information on what I do below.

Disclosure, I'm currently a full-time founder and plan to be one for the foreseeable future, so I cannot allocate full-time attention to portfolio companies. I usually only invest in companies building in similar environments to what I am currently or have built in the past, so I can directly help with problem-solving. Please see more [angel investing disclosures](https://lorimerjenkins.com/disclosures).

## Notable Things I Have Done That Could Help You

- I cannot advise you on legal/accounting issues, but I can point you in the direction of those who can — lawyers, accountants, and professionals (and try to make sure you don't get scammed with high fees). To date I have created 4 limited companies in the UK and 1 Delaware C corporation.
- Taught myself to be a fullstack developer from the internet
- Managed small lightweight teams that can execute fast
- Successfully closed multiple fundraising rounds from VCs, accelerators, grant foundations, and decentralised blockchain treasuries
- Failed at raising fundraising rounds
- Worked in startups/VCs/corporates and held pretty much every role, including CEO, engineer, analyst, had COO responsibilities and been a private software contractor
- As you can probably tell from my website, I am SCRAPPY. It is a superpower I have and one I hope I can help you develop/nurture.
- Launched a waitlist which had thousands of signups and grew to $55m in soft commits
- Built/designed/launched numerous products in startup and corporate environments
- Made pitch decks, pitches, and business plans successfully and unsuccessfully

## I Take On Problems Under Pressure and Solve Them

- Fixed 2 major black swan events in a live mainnet DeFi protocol
- Survived 3 major crypto bear markets
- Spoken in front of live/online audiences and both succeeded and TOTALLY fluffed speeches
- Purchased IP, sold IP, and acquired companies
- Built teams and both hired and fired team members
- Worked with accountants, lawyers, freelancers, and marketing firms
- Cold emailed companies/people successfully (these days I prefer warm intros)
- Pivoted products
- Had to be creative to solve delicate problems, usually with numerous sensitive verticals
- Had to give 1-1 negative feedback and also received it many times
- Been de-banked as a crypto founder
- Stood up to and squashed workplace & other founder bullies
- Worked in great company cultures, worked in bad ones, built good ones, and fixed my own company's culture numerous times
- In a previous life I was an actor. I can help you look human in social media content and demo day pitches
- Had successful VC pitches and really really bad ones
- Dealt with co-founder disputes multiple times
- Been through accelerator programs
- Judged and participated in hackathons (still not won one yet, loser)
- I know how to design products and how to use tools like Figma and Webflow

## Major Mistakes I Have Made That I Don't Want You To

- Spent over $50k USD on a funding round's legal fees that could have been $5k
- Spent $75k USD on an audit for a pre-product-market-fit product
- Spent a year building product and not fully focused on growth and marketing
- Triggered a tax bill that wiped out all my life savings and put me personally into a -$26k net worth and in debt overnight
- Absolutely demolished my credit score and personal finances as a founder, then rebuilt it
- Forgotten the value of a dollar and how far they go
- Lost literally thousands of dollars to fees from careless mistakes using incorrect software
- Developed and lost having a personal ego

## Building something interesting?

I'd love to hear about it.
